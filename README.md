# whole-cell-modelling-suite
This library is based on the Whole-Cell model by Karr et al. 2012 but is designed to be easily adapted to new whole-cell models as and when they become available. 

It uses the remote-computer-manager library to manage simulations across, potentially, multiple clusters. In addition to this it transforms the data into more practical formats and adds analysis tools to better understand the data.
